* Javascript functions:
	Very flexible compared to other languages. Missing an arg? Defaults to undefined. Have extra args? Just use the ones you need - we'll just put it on the arguments object for you, just in case you change your mind.

	A method can be written and then later told which object/prototype to associate with. You can access the source code of a function object, and even create functions and pass in a string of source code.

	I thought I loved Python functions and my *args and my **kwargs (ok - will miss those) and my lambdas. But the flexibility in Javascript is just... insane. I love it.
